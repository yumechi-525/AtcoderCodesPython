# AtcoderHandoutCodes
This repository is solving programming competition problem on Atcoder.
I write mainly Python, but python is very slow.
So, sometimes I write Java, C and other language.

My goal is to solve all Atcoder Regular Contest(ARC) and Atcoder Beginner Contest(ABC).

## Index
### ABC
Previous ABC problem.

### ARC
Previous ARC problem.

### OtherContest
Sometimes, AtCoder held open contest(JOI, Code festival, Indeed now and etc.)
This folder includes those contest source code.

### RealTime
I wrote program on time.
Those Code maybe dirty...
